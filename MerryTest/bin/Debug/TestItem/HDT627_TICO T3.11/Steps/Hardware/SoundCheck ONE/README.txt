By default, SoundCheck ONE will try to use the AmpConnect ISC configured for Windows 7 32/64 bit. To use one of the other 3 configurations supported by SoundCheck ONE, rename "System SCOne.Har" in the parent folder to something else such as "System SCOne.Har.OLD". Then copy the corresponding file to the parent folder and rename it to "System SCOne.Har".

Below is a list of included hardware steps and their configurations.

System SCOne.Har (in parent folder) --> AmpConnect ISC for use in Windows 7 32/64.
AmpConnect ISC WinXP.Har --> AmpConnect ISC for use in Windows XP ONLY.
CardDeluxe Balanced WinXP Win7 32bit.Har --> Configured for use with the CardDeluxe using balanced cables and the AmpConnect WITHOUT the internal sound card. Use when your OS is either Windows XP or Windows 7 32bit.
CardDeluxe Balanced 64bit w AmpConnect.Har --> same as above except this MUST be used when Windows 7 64-bit is your OS.
